Apphud allows to easily add new products, including convenient cross-platform iOS/Android products support.‌

You can customize which in-app purchases in the application will be displayed to your users remotely – control them without having to update the application.‌

Permission groups allow you to specify what level of access each product should unlock for your users, which can greatly simplify the code in your app to verify subscription access.‌

Use _Paywalls_ to change the products list of your paywall on the fly and send any configuration options you need without app updates.‌

It's also great for experimenting with how different price and paywall configurations affect key subscription metrics.‌
