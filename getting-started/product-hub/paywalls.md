# Paywalls

A paywall is a product array with custom JSON. The array is ordered and may be used to display products on your in-app purchase screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
Insert any parameters you need into custom JSON. It could be titles, descriptions, localisations, font, background and color parameters, URLs to media content, etc. Parameters count are not limited.
{% endhint %}

### Adding products to paywalls

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-05-04 at 17.55.36.png>)

Select a product from the list of all products.

You cannot add the same product twice to the paywall, but one product can be added to several paywalls.

### Sort products

Drag and drop products within the paywall to change its order.

{% hint style="info" %}
SDK always returns paywall products in a strict and defined order. So, you can put the list of corresponding products on the payment screen buttons.
{% endhint %}

### Delete product from paywall

### Delete paywall

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/prod10 (1).png>)

To delete the paywall, select the _"Remove"_ option.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you are not removing the active paywall that is being used in your app. If you do that, your payment screen logic and purchases will be broken.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you delete the paywall flagged as _default_, no other paywall will be set as a default one.
{% endhint %}

### Default paywall

![](../../.gitbook/assets/prod11.png)

It's possible to make a paywall _default_ â€“ it's a special alias name, that can be assigned to only ONE paywall at one time.

After setting some paywall as _default_ you can retrieve it using this special alias (and not its identifier). This is a great tool to switch your paywalls dynamically without app updates and run simple price tests

{% hint style="info" %}
There can be no default paywalls at all. It's up to you whether you want to have them or not.
{% endhint %}
