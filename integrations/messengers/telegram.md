# Telegram

Receive notifications about subscription events to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).

## How to Add Integration?

### Authorize the bot

* On Integrations page in Apphud click on _"Add Integration"_ button for Telegram.
* Click on _"Launch Apphud Bot"_ or find [`@ApphudBot`](http://t.me/apphudbot) in Telegram app.
* Start the bot and enter `/login` command.
* You will be prompted to enter your Apphud account email address.&#x20;
* Get a security code that will be sent with an email.
* Enter this security code in a bot chat.
* Bot is now authorized! Now link your app.

### Link your app to receive notifications

* Once authorized, you can enter `/link_apps` **** command to select the app and environments that you need.
* You can use `/unlink_apps` command to disable connection with your app.

### Adding bot to a group

You can add Apphud bot to a group or channel to receive notifications there.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Authorizing the bot directly in a group will not work. You must authorize it using private chat first.
{% endhint %}

* Authorize bot using private chat. Do **not** call `/link_apps` yet.
* Add bot to your desired group or channel.
* Call `/link_apps@ApphudBot` inside a group to link your app with it.
* If you have already linked your app with private chat, don't worry, you can re-link your app at any time.
